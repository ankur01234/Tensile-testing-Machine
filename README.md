# Tensile-testing-Machine
A mechanical Core Project.
The Tensile Testing Machine was designed to study the change in reaction of a polymer under different temperature.
For this, we used a stepper motor controlled by a microcontroller and a power supply. The Microcontroller was operated by the Arduino to take the reading of the Torque produced.
The Motor was connected to a Gear Train which was at last connected to a Shaft which could only move upward and Downward.
With the Shaft, we connected a Load cell to measure the applied force and we took the readings on the screen using Arduino CC. Since the Load uses Strain Gauges too, and the output was much smaller, we used the HX711 to amplify the output.
For controlling the Temperature, we used the PID micro controller which was connected in between the grips with the polymer. When turned ON, because of the infrared waves, the temperature increases creating a desired environment for the experiment.
